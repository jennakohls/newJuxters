# newJuxters
 
This is made with Pixi.js. docs are here: http://pixijs.download/release/docs/index.html
but i've included all the dependencies for now. 

to develop it locally, you will need to run a simple html server, because of CORS issues i'm looking into resolving. 

building the page with github fixes this (obviously) but you can only build from one branch at a time, so i'd prefer you don't use that for testing, and develop in your own branch.
